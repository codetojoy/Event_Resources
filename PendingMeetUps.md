Misc

- Michael E offers to do Java 9 modules at some point ([see thread](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/issues/55)), pending a vote that closes on June 26. August or esp. September would be timely (if all goes well politically).
- consider reaching out to UPEI (e.g. Dr Gordon MacDonald) for an info session on the new Data Analytics program as part of the new School of Math and CS
