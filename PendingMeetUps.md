### Misc

* Michael E offers to do Java 9 modules at some point ([see thread](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/issues/55)).
    * Given that the 2nd vote has passed, this talk would not include the political drama that was in the Maritime DevCon version. 
    * August or esp. September would be timely, given that it very likely that JDK 9 will be released in Sept 2017.
* Michael E offers a talk on Kotlin. Maybe Nov or Jan 2018, assuming there's a Java 9 talk in Aug/Sept.
* consider reaching out to UPEI (e.g. Dr Gordon MacDonald) for an info session on the new Data Analytics program as part of the new School of Math and CS
